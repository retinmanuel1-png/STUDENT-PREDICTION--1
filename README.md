Student Performance Predictor & Visualizer
This project analyzes the relationship between study hours and academic output for a group of 10 students. Using Python, the application takes input data, predicts potential outcomes (such as test scores or grades), and generates a comprehensive visual report to identify trends and performance gaps.

🚀 Features
Data Input: Collection of study hour metrics for 10 unique student profiles.

Predictive Analysis: Uses linear regression to estimate student outcomes based on their effort.

Visual Reporting: Automatically generates charts (Bar charts, Line graphs) to compare actual vs. predicted performance.

Summary Statistics: Calculates mean, median, and correlation coefficients for the dataset.

📊 How it Works
Input: The user provides a dataset (CSV or JSON) containing student names and their respective study hours.

Processing: The script cleans the data and applies a predictive model.

Output: * A consolidated table of results.
